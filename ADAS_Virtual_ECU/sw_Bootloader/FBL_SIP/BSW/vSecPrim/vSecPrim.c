 *********************************************************************************************************************/
/* Module specific MISRA deviations:

  MD_VSECPRIM_STPAR:
    Reason:     Artificially restricting the number of parameters to a function would lead to less readable code.
                The function parameters are chosen in accordance with specifications and are complemented by
                other necessary parameters, such as length indications for buffers. 
    Risk:       Usage of function is not easily comprehensible. 
    Prevention: Code review. 

  MD_VSECPRIM_8.7:
    Reason:     Following this MISRA rule would lead to unreadable code, as the constant fields are huge.
                Vector style guide prevents usage of static variables/constant objects in function scope.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: Not necessary

  MD_VSECPRIM_5.6:
    Reason:     Naming of the buffer and struct members are similar to provided parameters to make the code more
                readable.
    Risk:       One could read wrong and adapt the code falsely.
    Prevention: Covered by code review and tests.

  MD_VSECPRIM_11.4:
    Reason:     Casting between different pointer is necessary due to the nature of this library.
    Risk:       None - the basic types remain the same.
    Prevention: Covered by code review and tests.

  MD_VSECPRIM_13.1:
    Reason:     An assignment operator is being used in a boolean expression this decreases the
                readability of the code.
    Risk:       Code could be mistaken.
    Prevention: Additional comment is stated.

  MD_VSECPRIM_21.1:
    Reason:     There could be no wraparound because of the previous check.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_16.7:
    Reason:     Pointer can only be const when method is empty and only Dummy statements are used.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: Covered by code review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_14.6:
    Reason:     Two break statements are implemented to provide simple yet efficient code.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_19.1:
    Reason:     The included file contains wrapper functions that can be used in different contexts. Before including
                it, it is necessary to define the data type the wrappers shall be defined for.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_WATCHDOG:
    Reason:     Calling the watchdog trigger function depends basically on two factors:
                  - If the watchdog trigger function is a valid pointer
                  - Watchdog trigger level
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_P2VOID_CAST: MISRA Dir 1.1
    Reason:     The implicit conversion from a pointer to object type to a pointer to void is used calling functions
                that allow pointers to different object types as parameter.
    Risk:       There is an invalid conversion within the function from a pointer to void to a pointer to object type
                and thus invalid data are read.
    Prevention: Code inspection.

  MD_VSECPRIM_11.4_P2UINT8_CAST: MISRA Rule 11.4
    Reason:     The conversion from a pointer to void to a pointer to object type is used to access the object's memory bytewise.
                The size of the object's memory is known.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_REDUNDANT_OP:
    Reason:     The redundant operation is a side effect of a better readability of the code.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_CONFIGURATION_DEPENDENT_REDUNDANT_OP:
    Reason:     The redundant operation is a side effect of the configurability of the code and required to avoid
                compile errors in certain configurations.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_ASSIGNMENT_RESULT_IN_OP: Misra Rule 13.4
    Reason:     The result of an assignment is being used in an arithmetic operation or another assigning operation in
                order to keep the processing flow of the algorithm's complex arithmetic operations as they are 
                described in the algorithm's specification.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_USE_OF_BASIC_TYPES: Misra Dir 4.6
    Reason:     Only non safe files are affected.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: Review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_CONST_BOOL_OPERAND: Misra Rule 14.3
    Reason:     Boolean operand might be constant in definition depend on configuration.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_REDUNDANT_ASSIGNMENT: Misra Rule 2.2
    Reason:     Redundant assignment in last cycle of for loop.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_ALGORITHM_REQUIRED_ASSIGNMENT
    Reason:     Redundant assignment due to algorithm specification
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A


  MD_VSECPRIM_2.2
    Reason:     Redundant assignment to avoid compiler warning of use of potentially uninitialized variable.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_CONST_POINTER: Misra Rule 8.13
    Reason:     The function parameter is a pointer to a pointer. The object referenced by the inner pointer 
                (and therefore also by the pointer to the pointer) is modified or the outer pointer is passed to another function, 
                but this is not detected by QAC. Thus, the parameter can not be passed as pointer-to-const.
    Risk:       The use of a pointer referencing another pointer makes the code more complicated to understand.
    Prevention: Code review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_8.9
    Reason:     An array lies in static ROM, but is only accessed in one function.
    Risk:       Additional Rom usage.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_METRIC
    Reason:     A function in the QM part of the component violates a metric threshold. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend
    Prevention: Code review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_P2CONST_PARAMETER
    Reason:     A function in the QM part of the component expects a parameter to be of type 'pointer to var', 
                although the object addressed by the pointer is not modified. The parameter must be of type 
                'pointer to var' to be consistent with a corresponding function pointer type. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_UNUSED_FUNCTION
    Reason:     A function in the QM part of the component is not used in some configurations. This affects
                placeholder functions that are used when a certain algorithm is turned off. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_RETURN_PATHS
    Reason:     A function in the QM part of the component has more than one return path. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend
    Prevention: Code review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_REDUNDANT_ASSIGNMENT_OR_OPERATION
    Reason:     A redundant assignment or operation is made in the QM part of the component. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_CASTING_POINTER_TYPE
    Reason:     A pointer is cast to a pointer referencing an object of different type in the QM part 
                of the component. The function is proven in use.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_POINTER_ARITHMETIC
    Reason:     There is an arithmetic operation on a pointer in the QM part of the component. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_VARIABLE_IN_LOOP
    Reason:     In a for-loop, two variables instead of one are compared to a stopping criterion and are incremented
                in the QM part of the component. The function is proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_SHORT_DECREMENT_INCREMENT_OPERATION
    Reason:     A decrement or increment operation is used in combination with another operation in the QM part of the component.
                The function is proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_POINTER_CAST_TO_LARGER_TYPE
    Reason:     A pointer is cast to a type with a stricter alignment requirement in the QM part of the component.
                The function is proven in use.
    Risk:       None.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_WRAPAROUND
    Reason:     There is a wraparound in an unsigned arithmetic operation. This is intended due to the specification of the algorithm.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: Code review.
